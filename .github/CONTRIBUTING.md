This repository is used to manage the backlog for Octopus Deploy.

## Do not create issues here directly

If you've found a bug or something isn't working, please get in touch with [our support team](https://octopus.com/support) instead. We don't read new GitHub issues regularly, so if you post here it will likely not get a reply. But if you contact support we can probably help to find a workaround or make sure the issue gets prioritized properly.

If you have an suggestion or a feature request, please post it to [our UserVoice site](https://octopusdeploy.uservoice.com) so others can vote for it.
