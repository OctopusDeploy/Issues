# Contributing Octopus issues

This repository is used by the Octopus team to communicate with our community about what we are working on for the core Octopus Server product.

## Do not create issues here directly

If you've found a bug or something isn't working, please get in touch with [our support team](https://octopus.com/support). We don't read new GitHub issues regularly, so if you post here it will likely not get a reply. If you [contact support](https://octopus.com/support), we can probably help to find a workaround or make sure the issue gets prioritized properly.

If you have a suggestion or a feature request, please submit your idea on [our Octopus Deploy Roadmap site](https://roadmap.octopus.com/).

## If you are a member of the Octopus team

The Octopus team internally uses this repository as described in the [internal contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.internal.md).
